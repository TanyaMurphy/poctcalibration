Our main sources for the theoretical background for this project are:

## General: Textbooks and websites

- *Immunoassay: A Practical Guide* (especially, chapter 8) [@Law2005]

- <a href="http://www.graphpad.com/guides/prism/6/curve-fitting/index.htm?reg_principles_of_curve_fitting.htm target="_blank">GraphPad Prism: Principles of Curve Fitting</a>. Based on Motulsky and Christopoulos [-@Motulsky2003] with updates.

- *The Immunoassay Handbook: Theory and Applications of Ligand Binding* (especially, chapter 3.6) [@Dunn2013]

- <a href="http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/index.htm" target="_blank">Engineering Statistics Handbook</a>  

- *Statistical Tools for Nonlinear Regression* [@Huet2004]
