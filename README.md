# POCTcalibration

This `master` branch contains the source files that generate the [POCTcalibration website](http://weightinginbayesianmodels.github.io/poctcalibration/) of R tutorials for analysing diagnostic test calibration data. The website is hosted on GitHub using the `gh-pages` branch. There you will find the html, css, etc files.
